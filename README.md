- 👋 Hi, I’m @lwhxe. I am commonly known as Last Wish lunch break. You can call me whatever you want.
- 👀 I’m interested in Back-end and Low-level systems. However, I've been diving into more Front-end topics recently because I want to create a Desktop App and maybe a game eventually.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C/C++ and Web-Development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my "Quizless" application with anyone with insight into quiz or user-script design.
- 📫 You can reach me through my discord server, or by dm-ing me directly @lastwishlunchbreak
